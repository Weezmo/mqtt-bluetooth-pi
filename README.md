To get data from a Bluetooth device and send it to an MQTT broker on your Raspberry Pi running Raspbian OS Lite, you will need to follow these general steps:

1. Install the necessary Bluetooth software on your Raspberry Pi. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal:

   `````
   sudo apt-get install bluez
   ```

2. Pair your Bluetooth device with your Raspberry Pi. You can do this either by using the Bluetooth GUI or by running the following command in the terminal:

   ````
   bluetoothctl
   ````

   This will open the Bluetooth control panel. You can then use the `scan on` command to scan for nearby devices and the `pair <device-id>` command to pair with your Bluetooth device.

3. Install the necessary MQTT software on your Raspberry Pi. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal:

   ````
   sudo apt-get install mosquitto mosquitto-clients
   ````

4. Write a Python script that reads data from the Bluetooth device and publishes it to the MQTT broker. You can use the `bluepy` library to communicate with the Bluetooth device and the `paho-mqtt` library to publish data to the MQTT broker. Here's an example Python script:

   ````python
   import bluepy.btle as btle
   import paho.mqtt.publish as publish

   # Set the MAC address of your Bluetooth device
   MAC_ADDRESS = '00:11:22:33:44:55'

   # Set the topic to publish data to on the MQTT broker
   MQTT_TOPIC = 'bluetooth/data'

   # Set the hostname and port number of the MQTT broker
   MQTT_HOST = 'localhost'
   MQTT_PORT = 1883

   # Define a callback function to handle incoming Bluetooth data
   def handle_data(handle, value):
       # Convert the data to a string
       data = value.decode('utf-8')

       # Publish the data to the MQTT broker
       publish.single(MQTT_TOPIC, data, hostname=MQTT_HOST, port=MQTT_PORT)

   # Connect to the Bluetooth device and enable notifications for the data characteristic
   device = btle.Peripheral(MAC_ADDRESS)
   data_service = device.getServiceByUUID('0000fff0-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb')
   data_characteristic = data_service.getCharacteristics('0000fff1-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb')[0]
   data_characteristic_handle = data_characteristic.getHandle()
   device.writeCharacteristic(data_characteristic_handle+1, b'\x01\x00')

   # Set up a notification handler for incoming data
   device.withDelegate(btle.DefaultDelegate(handle_data))

   # Start the main loop to receive Bluetooth data and publish it to the MQTT broker
   while True:
       device.waitForNotifications()
   ```

   This script connects to the Bluetooth device with the specified MAC address, enables notifications for the data characteristic, and sets up a callback function to handle incoming data. The callback function converts the data to a string and publishes it to the MQTT broker. The script then enters a loop to wait for incoming Bluetooth data and publish it to the MQTT broker.

5. Run the Python script in the terminal using the following command:

   ````
   python bluetooth-mqtt.py
   ````

   This will start the script and begin reading data from the Bluetooth device and publishing it to the MQTT broker. You can then subscribe to the MQTT topic `bluetooth/data` to receive the data from the Bluetooth device.
